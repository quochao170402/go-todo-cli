# Go Todo List CLI

A simple command-line **Todo List application** written in Go.  
This project is designed for learning **Go basics, CLI development, and clean code practices** while building something practical.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose

The main goal of this project is to:

- Practice **Go programming fundamentals** (structs, slices, JSON, time handling)
- Learn **CLI argument parsing** and command handling
- Work with **UUIDs** for unique task identifiers
- Handle **file persistence** for storing tasks
- Build a **user-friendly CLI interface** with readable table output
- Explore **Go modules & project structure** for real-world applications

---

## ðŸ§  What You'll Learn

- **Structs & Methods** â€” defining and working with custom types like `Task` and `TodoList`
- **JSON Marshalling/Unmarshalling** â€” saving and loading data from a file
- **Command Parsing** â€” interpreting arguments to run different commands (`add`, `update`, `list`, etc.)
- **Formatting Output** â€” using Go's `text/tabwriter` for a nice console table
- **Aliases** â€” supporting both long and short CLI commands (e.g., `list` and `ls`)
- **Error Handling** â€” writing clear and safe error messages for invalid input
